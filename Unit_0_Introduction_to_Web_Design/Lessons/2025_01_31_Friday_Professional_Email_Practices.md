**Characteristics of a Professionally Formatted Email:**

|Component|Notes|
|---|---|
|**Email Address**|When crafting a professional email, one of the first things to keep in mind is the importance of maintaining your own professional email address.<br><br>Common professional formats often include parts of your name and initials.  For example, your nycstudents.net email.<br><br>You should not include any other personally identifiable information in your email address (e.g. parts of your birthday, street address, social security number, etc.).<br><br>Avoid email addresses that don't come across as serious such as partyanimal@email.com, sleepyhead@email.com, etc.<br><br>And, definitely avoid email addresses that are offensive or contain profanity!|
|**Purpose**|If you are sending an email, you should be sending it for a reason.<br><br>Before you start writing an email, take a moment to be sure you know why are are writing it.|
|**Subject**|Your subject should highlight what your email will be about.<br><br>  It should be descriptive, but short.<br><br>(1 to 3 words is generally a good length for a subject...5 words is usually too long...10 words is **always** too long!)|
|**Greeting**|Start with a professional greeting.  For example...<ul><li>Dear [recipient name],</li><li>Good Morning,</li><li>To Whom it May Concern, <i>(if you are sending an email to a group inbox such as a committee)</i></li><li>etc.</li></ul>
|**Additional Guidelines**|<ul><li>Keep your message clear and concise.</li><li>Maintain a professional, polite tone.</li><li>Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, block structure, etc.</li><li>End your email with a call to action (i.e., a specific thing you are asking of the recipient).</li></ul>|
|**Signature**|Close with a professional signature.  For example...<ul><li>Sincerely,</li><li>Best,</li><li>Thank You, </li><li>etc.</li></ul>Your signature should include:<ul><li>Your Name</li><li>Your Title</li><li>Your Organization</li><li>Your Email Address</li></ul>|
|**Review Your Email Before You Send It**|<ul><li>Is your purpose clear?</li><li>Does it meet the guidelines above?</li><li>If you read it to yourself, does it make sense? Does it sound professional and polite?</li><li>Does it have a professional appearance?</li><li>Is there anything you have left out?</li><li>Are there any final changes you need to make before clicking send?</li></ul>**Once you click "Send", you can't take it back!** |
|**Mindset**|Thinking of sending an email while Your mindset is off (e.g. you are angry, frustrated, upset, etc.)?<br><br>**DON'T!!!**<br><br>Give yourself time to reflect, and come back to it when your mindset is in a better place.<br><br>**Remember...Once you click "Send", you can't take it back!**|
