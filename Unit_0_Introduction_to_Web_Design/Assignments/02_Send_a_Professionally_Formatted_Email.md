# Unit 0, Assignment 02: Send a Professionally Formatted Email
Due: Monday, February 3rd 2025

## Step 1 - Determine the Purpose of Your Email

**Examples:**
1. Send an email to introduce yourself, describe any background you may have in technology, and explain what you hope to learn in Intro to Web Development.
2. Send an email to advocate for something you would like our class (or Inwood Early College) to start doing, do differently, etc.
3. Send an email to ask a specific question about something.

You may select one of the examples above or a different purpose of your own, but be sure your email has a purpose!

## Part 2: Craft Your Email

1. Navigate to your nycstudents.net account and start a new email.<br><i>(In general, always remember to use a professional email account)</i>.
2. Include a descriptive, but short subject.<br>(1 to 3 words is generally a good length for a subject...5 words is usually too long...10 words is **always** too long!) 
4. Draft your email.  Remember to keep the following guidelines in mind:

    * Start with a professional greeting.
    * Keep your message clear and concise.
    * Maintain a professional, polite tone.
    * Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, block structure, etc.
    * End your email with a call to action.

5. Include a signature at the bottom of your email.  Your signature should include the following:
     * Your Name
     * Your Title
     * Your Organization
     * Your Email Address

## Part 3: Review Your Email

* Is your purpose clear?
* Does it meet the guidelines above?
* If you read it to yourself, does it make sense? Does it sound professional and polite?
* Does it have a professional appearance?
* Is there anything you have left out?
* Are there any final changes you need to make before clicking send?
* What is your mindset? <br><br>Remember...Never send an email when you are angry. **Once you have clicked 'Send', you can't take it back!**

2. `Cc:` your email to Ms. Espiritu, **vespiritu@schools.nyc.gov**.
